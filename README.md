# :ramen: :fish_cake: THE C++ DOJO :ramen: :fish_cake: 
This is a repository to learn about C++ and develop different skills for embedded systems programming.<br>

I will be working on different projects like:
* A cmake structure project 
* The basis of c++ as a programming language
* A complete pointers course using c/c++
* Embedded systems projects

## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES :computer:
* [g++ compiler](https://www.cprogramming.com/g++.html) <br>
g++ command is a GNU c++ compiler invocation command, which is used for preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking of source code to generate an executable file. The different “options” of g++ command allow us to stop this process at the intermediate stage.  

* [gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) <br>
GCC is a collection of programming compilers including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada. Once installed, a basic C file, like the one shown on our C language page, can be compiled by running the command below.

* [gdb debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) <br>
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) <br>
CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
